In this lesson we learned:

1. Although it's not something you'd normally do, it is possible to interact with HTTP manually because it's a text-based protocol

2. HTTP is built on top of TCP, which is a networking layer that handles communicating between two computers.

3. URLs are made up of many components: protocol, host, port, path and parameters.

4. Query parameters are parameters that are included in a URL. They are appended to the path using `?`. Parameters are specified in the URL using the form `key=value`

5. Parameters after the first are appended to the URL using `&`

6. HTTP is stateless, which means that each request is handled separately by the server. By carefully crafting URLs and parameters, stateful interactions can be built on top of HTTP
