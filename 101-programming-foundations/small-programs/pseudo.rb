# 1. a method that returns the sum of two integers

# START

# GET number1 and number2 from user

# SET numbers = numbers.to_i

# SET result = number1 + number2

# PRINT result

# END

# 2. a method that takes an array of strings, and returns a string that is all
# those strings concatenated together

# START

# SET result = nil

# WHILE iterator < length of array

#   SET result = result + current_string

#   SET iterator = iterator + 1

# PRINT result

# END

# 3. a method that takes an array of integers, and returns a new array with
# every other element

# START

# SET new_array = []

# WHILE iterator < length of array

#   IF iterator is even

#     go to next iteration

#   ELSE

#     SET new_array << current_number

# PRINT new_array
